I created the repo to try to solve Advent of Code. 
As a database developer, I plan to solve it using MS SQL only.
Will see how it goes! 🎄🎁🧑‍💻

I am starting with 2025, but if I like it, I will solve previous years as well.
Each year is going to have its own branch prefix.
Each day is going to have its own branch.
For example, 2025/1.
